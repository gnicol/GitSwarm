                            Release Notes for
                     Helix GitSwarm Enterprise Edition

                             Version 2016.1

Introduction

    Helix GitSwarm Enterprise Edition (EE) extends the GitLab Enterprise
    Edition (EE) software to let users using Git maintain their code
    repositories in Perforce Helix, facilitating contributions and
    collaboration between users using Git and users using P4 on complex
    products containing source code and binaries. Additionally, by
    maintaining the code repository in the Helix Versioning Engine,
    GitSwarm EE enables an enterprise to manage and secure all of its
    Intellectual Property (IP) in one place.

    GitSwarm EE offers additional features on top of the base GitSwarm
    offering, such as LDAP group synchronization, sharing of native
    GitSwarm projects with other groups, Git hooks, and Atlassian Jira
    integration.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.

    Please see the separate "upgrade" file, a peer to this file.

Known Issues

    * Helix Mirroring stops working when a GitSwarm EE project involves
      commits that contain only tags and no file changes.

    * GitSwarm EE allows you to merge task branches using fast-forward
      merges. Behind the scenes, this involves rebasing and forced pushes.
      Helix Mirroring is incompatible with these operations, and so the
      "Fast-forward merge" and "Merge commit with semi-linear history"
      options on your GitSwarm EE project pages, for mirrored projects, do
      not work.

    * GitSwarm EE project names can only contain letters, numbers,
      underscores, periods, and dashes, and must begin with a letter,
      number, or underscore.

      Since depot paths in the Helix Versioning Engine (P4D) can contain
      Unicode and other special characters, we recommend depot paths for
      projects you intend on importing into GitSwarm EE via Git Fusion
      adhere to the naming convention described above.

      If you are using multi-byte characters in any of your Git Fusion
      repository names, you should use an SSH connection to Git Fusion.

    * If a new project is created and GitSwarm EE is used to automatically
      mirror it (via convention-based mirroring), updating the project's
      namespace and/or project name does *not* change the location under
      Helix Versioning Engine (P4D). In order to move the project's files
      to a new location, you need to delete the project, re-create it with
      convention-based mirroring, and then re-add the files.

    * Once a project has been created with mirroring to Git Fusion,
      changing the settings in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb` does not update
      the mirroring settings for the project (or any other project). This
      can result in problems that prevent pushing new changes to the
      project. Unfortunately, the solution is to delete the project,
      correct the settings in `gitswarm.rb`, and then re-create the
      project.

    * Git Fusion, when installed on CentOS/RHEL 7.x, does not support
      HTTP(S) authentication. This issue prevents pushing new work to a Git
      Fusion repo, including any updates in GitSwarm EE that would be
      mirrored to Git Fusion. Instead, use SSH connections when Git Fusion
      is hosted on CentOS/RHEL 7.x.

    * An error related to setting LANG/LC_ALL can show up when GitSwarm EE
      tries to connect to a remote Helix Git Fusion server (running on
      CentOS/RHEL 6.6+) over SSH, as part of mirroring setup on the
      `Create Project` page. Please see the Helix mirroring documentation
      for help.
