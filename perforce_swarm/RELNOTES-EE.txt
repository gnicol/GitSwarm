                             Release Notes for
                      Helix GitSwarm Enterprise Edition

                              Version 2015.2

Introduction

    Helix GitSwarm Enterprise Edition (EE) extends the Gitlab Enterprise
    Edition (EE) software to let users using Git maintain their code
    repositories in Perforce Helix, facilitating contributions and
    collaboration between users using Git and users using P4 on complex
    products containing source code and binaries. Additionally, by
    maintaining the code repository in the Helix Versioning Engine,
    GitSwarm EE enables an enterprise to manage and secure all of its
    Intellectual Property (IP) in one place.

    GitSwarm EE offers additional features on top of the base GitSwarm
    offering, such as LDAP group synchronization, sharing of native
    GitSwarm projects with other groups, Git hooks, Atlassian Jira
    integration, and managing binaries with Git Annex.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.
