                             Release Notes for
                      Helix GitSwarm Enterprise Edition

                              Version 2015.3

Introduction

    Helix GitSwarm Enterprise Edition (EE) extends the Gitlab Enterprise
    Edition (EE) software to let users using Git maintain their code
    repositories in Perforce Helix, facilitating contributions and
    collaboration between users using Git and users using P4 on complex
    products containing source code and binaries. Additionally, by
    maintaining the code repository in the Helix Versioning Engine,
    GitSwarm EE enables an enterprise to manage and secure all of its
    Intellectual Property (IP) in one place.

    GitSwarm EE offers additional features on top of the base GitSwarm
    offering, such as LDAP group synchronization, sharing of native
    GitSwarm projects with other groups, Git hooks, and Atlassian Jira
    integration.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.

Documentation

    GitSwarm EE Release 2015.3 documentation is included in the distribution
    and can be accessed from within GitSwarm from the "?" menu on the top
    toolbar

Supported Client Browsers

    GitSwarm EE supports the following client web browsers and versions:

    * Chrome (Latest stable version)
    * Firefox (Latest released version and latest ESR version)
    * Safari 7+ (known problem: required fields in html5 do not work)
    * Opera (Latest released version)
    * IE 10+

    We recommend the use of the latest stable version of the browsers
    listed above for the best experience when using GitSwarm EE.

    Other web browsers might also work, including prior, development or
    beta builds of the above web browsers, but these browsers are not
    officially supported.

Installation and Supported Platforms

    Please see the separate "install" file, a peer to this file.

Upgrading

    Please see the separate "upgrade" file, a peer to this file.

Known Issues

    * Importing large repos into GitSwarm can take long enough that a
      timeout is reached, causing the import to fail. The workaround is
      to manually prepare a local repository, and push that repo into
      GitSwarm.

    * Git Fusion HTTP(S) authentication is not supported on CentOS 7 or
      Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
