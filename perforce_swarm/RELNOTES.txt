                              Version 2015.2

Introduction

    Helix GitSwarm enables users to manage revisions of content using Git,
    and collaborate on a project using a "pull-request" code review workflow.
    In addition to the pull-request workflow, GitSwarm also offers an issue
    tracker, a wiki, and a user interface to manage code repositories.
    GitSwarm is based on the Gitlab Open Source Community Edition software.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.
