                             Release Notes for
                              Helix GitSwarm

                              Version 2015.2

Introduction

    Helix GitSwarm extends the Gitlab Community Edition (CE) software to
    let users using Git maintain their code repositories in Perforce Helix,
    facilitating contributions and collaboration between users using Git and
    users using P4 on complex products containing source code and binaries.
    Additionally, by maintaining the code repository in Helix, GitSwarm
    enables enterprise to manage and secure all of its Intellectual Property
    (IP) in one place.  GitSwarm offers users an interface to manage code
    repositories, means to fork repositories hosted in Helix and collaborate
    on a project using a "pull-request" style code review workflow.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.
