                             Release Notes for
                              Helix GitSwarm

                              Version 2015.3

Introduction

    Helix GitSwarm extends the Gitlab Community Edition (CE) software to
    let users using Git maintain their code repositories in Perforce Helix,
    facilitating contributions and collaboration between users using Git and
    users using P4 on complex products containing source code and binaries.
    Additionally, by maintaining the code repository in the Helix Versioning
    Engine, GitSwarm enables an enterprise to manage and secure all of its
    Intellectual Property (IP) in one place. GitSwarm offers users an
    interface to manage code repositories, means to fork repositories hosted
    in Helix and collaborate on a project using a "pull-request" style code
    review workflow.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.

Documentation

    GitSwarm Release 2015.3 documentation is included in the distribution and
    can be accessed from within GitSwarm from the "?" menu on the top toolbar

Supported Client Browsers

    GitSwarm supports the following client web browsers and versions:

    * Chrome (Latest stable version)
    * Firefox (Latest released version and latest ESR version)
    * Safari 7+ (known problem: required fields in html5 do not work)
    * Opera (Latest released version)
    * IE 10+

    We recommend the use of the latest stable version of the browsers
    listed above for the best experience when using GitSwarm.

    Other web browsers might also work, including prior, development or
    beta builds of the above web browsers, but these browsers are not
    officially supported.

Installation and Supported Platforms

    Please see the separate "install" file, a peer to this file.

Upgrading

    Please see the separate "upgrade" file, a peer to this file.

Known Issues

    * Importing large repos into GitSwarm can take long enough that a
      timeout is reached, causing the import to fail. The workaround is
      to manually prepare a local repository, and push that repo into
      GitSwarm.

    * Git Fusion HTTP(S) authentication is not supported on CentOS 7 or
      Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
