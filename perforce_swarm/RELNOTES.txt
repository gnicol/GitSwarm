                            Release Notes for
                             Helix GitSwarm

                             Version 2016.1

Introduction

    Helix GitSwarm extends the GitLab Community Edition (CE) software to
    let users using Git maintain their code repositories in Perforce Helix,
    facilitating contributions and collaboration between users using Git
    and users using P4 on complex products containing source code and
    binaries. Additionally, by maintaining the code repository in the Helix
    Versioning Engine, GitSwarm enables an enterprise to manage and secure
    all of its Intellectual Property (IP) in one place. GitSwarm offers
    users an interface to manage code repositories, means to fork
    repositories hosted in Helix and collaborate on a project using a
    "pull-request" style code review workflow.

    Please send all feedback to support@perforce.com.

Documentation

    GitSwarm Release 2016.1 documentation is included in the distribution
    and can be accessed from within GitSwarm from the "?" menu on the top
    toolbar. The latest GitSwarm Release documentation can be found online
    at:
    https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/gitswarm/

Supported Client Browsers

    GitSwarm supports the following client web browsers and versions:

    * Chrome (Latest stable version)
    * Firefox (Latest released version and latest ESR version)
    * Safari 7+ (known problem: required fields in html5 do not work)
    * Opera (Latest released version)
    * IE 10+

    We recommend the use of the latest stable version of the browsers
    listed above for the best experience when using GitSwarm.

    Other web browsers might also work, including prior, development or
    beta builds of the above web browsers, but these browsers are not
    officially supported.

Installation and Supported Platforms

    Please see the separate "install" file, a peer to this file.

Upgrading

    Please see the separate "upgrade" file, a peer to this file.

Known Issues

    * Helix Mirroring stops working when a GitSwarm project involves
      commits that contain only tags and no file changes.

    * GitSwarm project names can only contain letters, numbers,
      underscores, periods, and dashes, and must begin with a letter,
      number, or underscore.

      Since depot paths in the Helix Versioning Engine (P4D) can contain
      Unicode and other special characters, we recommend depot paths for
      projects you intend on importing into GitSwarm via Git Fusion adhere
      to the naming convention described above.

      If you are using multi-byte characters in any of your Git Fusion
      repository names, you should use an SSH connection to Git Fusion.

    * If a new project is created and GitSwarm is used to automatically
      mirror it (via convention-based mirroring), updating the project's
      namespace and/or project name does *not* change the location under
      Helix Versioning Engine (P4D). In order to move the project's files
      to a new location, you need to delete the project, re-create it with
      convention-based mirroring, and then re-add the files.

    * Once a project has been created with mirroring to Git Fusion,
      changing the settings in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb` does not update
      the mirroring settings for the project (or any other project). This
      can result in problems that prevent pushing new changes to the
      project. Unfortunately, the solution is to delete the project,
      correct the settings in `gitswarm.rb`, and then re-create the
      project.

    * Git Fusion, when installed on CentOS/RHEL 7.x, does not support
      HTTP(S) authentication. This issue prevents pushing new work to a Git
      Fusion repo, including any updates in GitSwarm that would be mirrored
      to Git Fusion. Instead, use SSH connections when Git Fusion is hosted
      on CentOS/RHEL 7.x.

    * An error related to setting LANG/LC_ALL can show up when GitSwarm
      tries to connect to a remote Helix Git Fusion server (running on
      CentOS/RHEL 6.6+) over SSH, as part of mirroring setup on the
      `Create Project` page. Please see the Helix mirroring documentation
      for help.
