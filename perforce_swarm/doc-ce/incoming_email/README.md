# Reply by email

$GitSwarm$ can be set up to allow users to comment on issues and merge
requests by replying to notification emails.

## Get a mailbox

Reply by email requires an IMAP-enabled email account, with a provider or
server that supports [email
sub-addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Sub-addressing).
Sub-addressing is a feature where any email to
`user+some_arbitrary_tag@example.com` will end up in the mailbox for
`user@example.com`, and is supported by providers such as Gmail, Google
Apps, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com and iCloud, as well as the Postfix mail
server which you can run on-premises.

If you want to use Gmail / Google Apps with Reply by email, make sure you
have [IMAP access
enabled](https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en#ts=1665018)
and [allow less secure apps to access the
account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).

To set up a basic Postfix mail server with IMAP access on Ubuntu, follow
[these instructions](./postfix.md).

## Set it up

1.  Find the `incoming_email` section in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`,
    enable the feature and fill in the details for your specific IMAP
    server and email account:

    ```ruby
    # Configuration for Postfix mail server, assumes mailbox
    # incoming@gitswarm.example.com
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_enabled'] = true
    
    # The email address including a placeholder for the key that references
    # the item being replied to.
    # The `%{key}` placeholder is added after the user part, before the
    # `@`.
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_address'] = "incoming+%{key}@gitswarm.example.com"
    
    # Email account username
    # With third party providers, this is usually the full email address.
    # With self-hosted email servers, this is usually the user part of the
    # email address.
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_email'] = "incoming"
    # Email account password
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_password'] = "[REDACTED]"
    
    # IMAP server host
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_host'] = "gitswarm.example.com"
    # IMAP server port
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_port'] = 143
    # Whether the IMAP server uses SSL
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_ssl'] = false
    # Whether the IMAP server uses StartTLS
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_start_tls'] = false

    # The mailbox where incoming mail will end up. Usually "inbox".
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_mailbox_name'] = "inbox"
    ```

    ```ruby
    # Configuration for Gmail / Google Apps, assumes mailbox
    # gitswarm-incoming@gmail.com
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_enabled'] = true
    
    # The email address including the `%{key}` placeholder that will be
    # replaced to reference the item being replied to.
    # The `%{key}` placeholder is added after the user part, after a `+`
    # character, before the `@`.
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_address'] = "gitswarm-incoming+%{key}@gmail.com"
    
    # Email account username
    # With third party providers, this is usually the full email address.
    # With self-hosted email servers, this is usually the user part of the
    # email address.
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_email'] = "gitswarm-incoming@gmail.com"
    # Email account password
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_password'] = "[REDACTED]"
    
    # IMAP server host
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_host'] = "imap.gmail.com"
    # IMAP server port
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_port'] = 993
    # Whether the IMAP server uses SSL
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_ssl'] = true
    # Whether the IMAP server uses StartTLS
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_start_tls'] = false

    # The mailbox where incoming mail will end up. Usually "inbox".
    gitlab_rails['incoming_email_mailbox_name'] = "inbox"
    ```

    As mentioned, the part after `+` in the address is ignored, and any
    email sent here will end up in the mailbox for
    `incoming@gitswarm.example.com`/`gitswarm-incoming@gmail.com`.

1.  Reconfigure $GitSwarm$ and restart mailroom for the changes to take
    effect:

    ```bash
    sudo gitswarm-ctl reconfigure
    sudo gitswarm-ctl restart mailroom
    ```

1.  Verify that everything is configured correctly:

    ```bash
    sudo gitswarm-rake gitswarm:incoming_email:check
    ```

1.  Reply by email should now be working.
