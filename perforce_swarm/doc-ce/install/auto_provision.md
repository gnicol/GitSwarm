# Auto provision

By default GitSwarm will automatically provision a Helix Server and connected Helix Git Fusion for you.

If you wish to use an existing Helix Git Fusion instance you can comment out the 'local' instance and add new config
entries:
```
#gitswarm['git-fusion']['local']['url']          = :auto_provision
#gitswarm['git-fusion']['local']['password']     = '<PASSWORD>'
```

**[Instructions on configuring the connection to external Helix Git Fusion can be found here](../workflow/importing/import_from_gitfusion.md#configuration)**.

When GitSwarm is left in its `local` auto-provision mode, the Helix Server is configured with the following configuration:

- Port
    - ssl:1666
- Users
    - gitswarm (password generated and stored in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`, super user privilege)
    - root (password default `5iveL!fe`, super user privilege)
- Root
    - `/var/opt/gitswarm/perforce/data`
- Unicode enabled
- Case sensitive
- Depot `gitswarm`
- p4dctl is used to interact with the server and is configured in `/etc/perforce/p4dctl.conf.d/gitswarm.conf`

When the `root` user password is updated from the GitSwarm UI the password change will also take effect for the
`root` Perforce user.

If `:auto_provision` is not specified in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb` when `sudo gitswarm-ctl reconfigure` is executed any
running auto provisioned instance will be shut down and disabled from automatic start up on boot in the p4dctl
configuration.

The following steps are taken when a default Helix Git Fusion is configured:

- The `configure-git-fusion` script provided by the package is executed
- An SSH key is generated for the `git-fusion` OS user
- A temporary P4 client is used to check this key into Perforce
- A cron task configured in `/etc/cron.d/perforce-git-fusion` is created to check for new user keys and update
  `~git-fusion/.ssh/authorized_keys`

If `:auto_provision` is not specified in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb` when `sudo gitswarm-ctl reconfigure`
is executed the cron task will be removed.
