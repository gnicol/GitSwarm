# Crowd OmniAuth Provider

To enable the Crowd OmniAuth provider you must register your application
with Crowd. To configure Crowd integration you need an application name and
password.

1.  On your $GitSwarm$ server, open the configuration file.

    ```bash
    sudo editor /etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb
    ```

1.  See [Initial OmniAuth
    Configuration](omniauth.md#initial-omniauth-configuration) for initial
    settings.

1.  Add the provider configuration:

    ```ruby
    gitlab_rails['omniauth_providers'] = [
      {
        "name" => "crowd",
        "args" => { 
          "crowd_server_url" => "CROWD",
          "application_name" => "YOUR_APP_NAME",
          "application_password" => "YOUR_APP_PASSWORD"
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

1.  Change 'YOUR_APP_NAME' to the application name from Crowd applications
    page.

1.  Change 'YOUR_APP_PASSWORD' to the application password you've set.

1.  Save the configuration file.

1.  Restart $GitSwarm$ for the changes to take effect.

On the sign in page there should now be a Crowd tab in the sign in form.
