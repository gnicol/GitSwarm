# $GitSwarm$ Configuration

$GitSwarm$ Performance Monitoring is disabled by default. To enable it and
change any of its settings, navigate to the Admin area in **Settings >
Metrics** (`/admin/application_settings`).

The minimum required settings you need to set are the InfluxDB host and
port. Make sure _Enable InfluxDB Metrics_ is checked and hit **Save** to
save the changes.

Finally, a restart of all $GitSwarm$ processes is required for the changes to
take effect:

```bash
sudo gitswarm-ctl restart
```

## Pending Migrations

When any migrations are pending, the metrics are disabled until the
migrations have been performed.
