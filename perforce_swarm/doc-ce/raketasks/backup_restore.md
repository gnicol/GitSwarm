# Backup and restore

A backup creates an archive file that contains the database, all
repositories, and all attachments. This archive will be saved in
`backup_path` (find that configuration key within
`/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`).

The archive filename is constructed as `$TIMESTAMP_gitswarm_backup.tar`,
where `$TIMESTAMP` is the Unix time in seconds when the backup archive is
created. This timestamp can be used to restore a specific backup.

You can only restore a backup to exactly the same version of GitSwarm (or
the corresponding version of GitLab; see
[below](#restore-a-previously-created-backup) for details) that
it was created on, for example 2015.4. The best way to migrate your
repositories from one server to another is through backup/restore.

**Note:**
You need to keep a separate copy of the `/etc/gitswarm` directory, as this
contains the operational configuration for GitSwarm, and encryption keys
for the database (for users who have two-factor authentication enabled).
See the [steps for configuration backup](#backup-the-configuration).

**Note:**
If you have enabled mirroring for any of your projects, you will need to backup
any associated Helix server instances separately, *after* you have performed the
GitSwarm backup. See the [Backup and
Recovery](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4sag/chapter.backup.html)
chapter in the [_Helix Versioning Engine Administrator Guide:
Fundamentals_](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4sag/index.html).

**Note:**
If you are using the `:auto_provisioned` Helix server instance (which we do not
recommend for production systems), the following information may be helpful:

    * P4ROOT is /var/opt/gitswarm/perforce/data
    * the `root` user can log in to the auto_provisioned Helix server with the
      GitSwarm `root` user's password
    * the `p4d` binary is located in `/opt/perforce/sbin`

If you are interested in GitLab CI backup please follow to the [CI backup
documentation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci/blob/master/doc/raketasks/backup_restore.md)\*

**Important:**
We recommend that you store your backup files in a safe location, and at
a secure offsite location as a disaster prevention measure.

## Creating a backup

```
sudo gitswarm-rake gitswarm:backup:create
```

You can choose what should be backed up by adding the environment
variable `SKIP`. Available options: `db`, `uploads` (attachments), and
`repositories`. Use a comma to specify several options at the same time.

```
sudo gitswarm-rake gitswarm:backup:create SKIP=db,uploads
```

Example output:

### Backup archive permissions

The backup archives created by GitSwarm (`123456_gitswarm_backup.tar` above)
have owner/group `git:git` and `0600` permissions by default. This is meant to
avoid other system users reading GitSwarm's data. If you need the backup
archives to have different permissions you can use the
`archive_permissions` setting.

```
# In /etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb
# 0644 makes the backup archives world-readable
gitlab_rails['backup_archive_permissions'] = 0644
```

### Backup the configuration

Please be aware that the backup task does not backup your GitSwarm
configuration. One reason for this is that your database contains encrypted
information for two-factor authentication. Storing encrypted information
along with its key in the same place defeats the purpose of using
encryption in the first place!

All of the configuration for GitSwarm is stored in `/etc/gitswarm`. To
backup your configuration:

```
# Creates a timestamped .tar file in the current directory
sudo sh -c 'umask 0077; tar -cf $(date "+etc-gitswarm-%s.tar") -C / etc/gitswarm
```

You can extract the `.tar` file as follows:

```
# Rename the existing /etc/gitswarm, if any
sudo mv /etc/gitswarm /etc/gitswarm.$(date +%s)
# Change the example timestamp below to match your configuration backup
sudo tar -xf etc-gitswarm-1399948539.tar -C /
```

Remember to run `sudo gitswarm-ctl reconfigure` after restoring a
configuration backup.

Note: Your machine's SSH host keys are stored separately in `/etc/ssh`. Be
sure to also [backup and restore those
keys](https://superuser.com/questions/532040/copy-ssh-keys-from-one-server-to-another-server/532079#532079)
to avoid man-in-the-middle attack warnings if you have to perform a full
machine restore.

**Important:**
**Do not store your GitSwarm application backups in the same place as your
configuration backup.** The configuration backup can contain database
encryption keys to protect sensitive data in the SQL database:

* GitSwarm two-factor authentication (2FA) user secrets ('QR codes')
* GitLab CI 'secure variables'

If you keep your configuration backup in a different place from your
application data backup you reduce the chances of exposing the sensitive
data mentioned above in case one of your application backups is
lost/leaked/stolen.

### Configure cron to make daily backups

To schedule a cron job that backs up your repositories and GitSwarm
metadata, use the root user:

```
sudo su -
crontab -e
```

There, add the following line to schedule the backup for everyday at 2 AM:

```
0 2 * * * /opt/gitswarm/bin/gitswarm-rake gitswarm:backup:create CRON=1
```

You may also want to set a limited lifetime for backups to prevent regular
backups using all your disk space. To do this add the following lines to
`/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb` and reconfigure:

```
# limit backup lifetime to 7 days - 604800 seconds
gitlab_rails['backup_keep_time'] = 604800
```

**Note:**
This cron job does not [backup your GitSwarm
configuration](#backup-the-configuration) or [SSH host
keys](https://superuser.com/questions/532040/copy-ssh-keys-from-one-server-to-another-server/532079#532079).

## Restore a previously created backup

**Important:**
You can only restore a backup to GitSwarm if the backup was created on the
same version of GitSwarm, or the corresponding version of GitLab. For example,
a backup taken on GitLab 8.0.5 can be restored to a 2015.4 GitSwarm install.
Here is a list of the GitSwarm releases and their corresponding GitLab releases:

| **GitLab CE** | **GitSwarm**  |
| ------------  | ------------- |
| 8.0.5         | 2015.4        |

### Prerequisites

You need to have a working GitSwarm installation before you can perform a
restore. This is mainly because the system user performing the restore
actions ('git') is usually not allowed to create or delete the SQL database
it needs to import data into ('gitlabhq_production'). All existing data
will be either erased (SQL) or moved to a separate directory (repositories,
uploads).

If you are also restoring Helix Versioning Engine (P4D) backups, it is better
to restore Helix Versioning Engine before restoring GitSwarm.

If some or all of your GitLab users are using two-factor authentication
(2FA) then you must also make sure to restore the backup of the
configuration from `/etc/gitswarm`. Note that you need to run
`gitswarm-ctl reconfigure` after changing anything in `/etc/gitswarm`.

### Restoration procedure

We assume that you have installed GitSwarm and have run
`sudo gitswarm-ctl reconfigure` at least once.

1.  **Make sure your that backup `.tar` file is in the correct location.**

    The backup `.tar` file should appear in `/var/opt/gitswarm/backups` (or
    wherever `gitlab_rails['backup_path']` points to).

    ```
sudo cp 1393513186_gitswarm_backup.tar /var/opt/gitswarm/backups/
    ```

1.  **Restore the backup by running the restore command.**

    You need to specify the timestamp of the backup you are restoring.

    1.  **Stop GitSwarm processes:**

        ```
sudo gitswarm-ctl stop unicorn
sudo gitswarm-ctl stop sidekiq
        ```

    1.  **Run the restoration task:**

        ```
# This command overwrites the contents of your GitSwarm database!
sudo gitswarm-rake gitswarm:backup:restore BACKUP=1393513186
        ```

    1.  **Restart GitSwarm processes:**

        ```
sudo gitswarm-ctl start
        ```

    1.  **Check GitSwarm:**

        ```
sudo gitswarm-rake gitswarm:check SANITIZE=true
        ```

If there is a GitSwarm version mismatch between your backup tar file and
the installed version of GitSwarm, the restore command aborts with an
error.

## Alternative backup strategies

If your GitSwarm server contains a lot of git repository data, you may find
the GitSwarm backup script to be too slow. In this case you can consider
using filesystem snapshots as part of your backup strategy.

Example: Amazon EBS

> A GitLab server using omnibus-gitlab hosted on Amazon AWS. An EBS drive
> containing an ext4 filesystem is mounted at `/var/opt/gitswarm`. In this
> case you could make an application backup by taking an EBS snapshot. The
> backup includes all repositories, uploads and Postgres data.

Example: LVM snapshots + rsync

> A GitSwarm server with an LVM logical volume mounted at
> `/var/opt/gitswarm`. Replicating the `/var/opt/gitswarm` directory using
> rsync would not be reliable because too many files could change while
> rsync is running. Instead of rsync-ing `/var/opt/gitswarm`, we create a
> temporary LVM snapshot, which we mount as a read-only filesystem at
> `/mnt/gitswarm_backup`. Now we can have a longer running rsync job which
> will create a consistent replica on the remote server. The replica
> includes all repositories, uploads and Postgres data.

If you are running GitSwarm on a virtualized server, you can possibly also
create VM snapshots of the entire GitSwarm server. It is not uncommon
however for a VM snapshot to require you to power down the server, so this
approach is probably of limited practical use.

## Troubleshooting

### Restoring database backup outputs warnings

During restoration, you might encounter the following warnings:

```
psql:/var/opt/gitswarm/backups/db/database.sql:22: ERROR:  must be owner of extension plpgsql
psql:/var/opt/gitswarm/backups/db/database.sql:2931: WARNING:  no privileges could be revoked for "public" (two occurences)
psql:/var/opt/gitswarm/backups/db/database.sql:2933: WARNING:  no privileges were granted for "public" (two occurences)
```

Be advised that, the restoration is successful in spite of these warnings.

The rake task runs this as the `git` user which does not have the superuser
access to the database. When restore is initiated it will also run as `git`
user but it will also try to alter the objects it does not have access to.
Those objects have no influence on the database backup/restore but they
give this annoying warning.

### Issue storage

Issues are stored in the database. They are not stored using git.
