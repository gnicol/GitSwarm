## Disable Helix Mirroring

Once Helix mirroring has been [enabled](enable.md), it can be disabled.
When disabled, the Git Fusion [configuration](configuration.md) remains in
the `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.md` file. Projects that have disabled Helix
mirroring should display 'Previously mirrored in Helix'.

To disable Helix mirroring for a project:

1.  Visit the project's settings page.

1.  Click the **Disable Helix Mirroring** button. You are prompted **Are
    you sure?**.

1.  Click **Yes**. The project is no longer mirrored into Helix.

> Note: At this point, the button switches to read **Re-enable Helix
  Mirroring**. See the [re-enable documentation](reenable.md) for details
  about re-enabling Helix mirroring.
