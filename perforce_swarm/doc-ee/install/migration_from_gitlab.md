# Migration from GitLab

## Introduction

If you already have a deployed GitLab (CE or EE) instance with existing
projects, but wish to use GitSwarm EE, it is possible to migrate your GitLab EE
data (workflow + Git repositories) over to GitSwarm EE. This will allow you to
have the complete and supported offering from one vendor, as well as leveraging
Perforce Helix as the master for all assets.

## Requirements

1.  **Compatible versions**

    Only the following version combinations of GitLab EE and GitSwarm EE are
    supported for migration. This is a hard requirement; the migration process
    **will not work** unless your GitLab EE and GitSwarm EE instances match one
    of the version combinations below:

    |Gitlab EE|GitSwarm EE|
    |---|---|
    |8.0.5|15.4|

    **Important Notes:**
    * GitLab EE to GitSwarm EE migration is not supported on GitSwarm EE
      versions less than 15.4 (GitLab EE 8.0.5).
    * Migration is supported across differing operating systems (e.g. migration
      from GitLab EE running on CentOS 6 to GitSwarm EE running on Ubuntu 14).
    * Migrating from GitLab CE to GitSwarm EE can be accomplished by migrating
      from GitLab CE to GitSwarm, then upgrading to GitSwarm EE.

1.  **An existing GitLab EE install**

    If the GitLab EE instance you're looking to migrate from is not on the above
    list, you will need to follow [these instructions](/help/update/README.md)
    to upgrade as necessary to a supported version (>= 8.0.5).

1.  **A new, up-to-date GitSwarm EE install**

    If the GitSwarm EE instance you're looking to migrate to is not on the above
    list, you will need to follow [these instructions](/help/update/README.md)
    to upgrade as necessary to a supported version.

    Migrating GitLab EE to an existing GitSwarm EE (one that has existing users,
    projects and repositories) will result in this data being overwritten and/or
    destroyed during the migration. It is highly recommended that you only
    migrate to a fresh/clean GitSwarm EE instance to avoid this issue.

    If the GitLab EE install from which you are migrating has attachments, you
    will either need to use the same hostname for your GitSwarm EE install, or
    once migration is complete, you will need to change the GitSwarm EE
    instance's hostname to match the original GitLab EE instance's hostname.

1.  **Recommended Approach**

    The recommended approach is to upgrade your GitLab EE and GitSwarm EE
    instances to the most up-to-date combination (GitLab EE 8.0.5 and
    GitSwarm EE 15.4). Upgrading to GitSwarm EE 15.4 (and GitLab EE 8.0.5) is an
    absolute requirement for GitSwarm EE, since migration is not supported in
    earlier versions. See [these instructions](/help/update/README.md) for how
    to upgrade.

    It is also recommended that the same hostname be used for both the GitLab EE
    and GitSwarm EE instances, since this will ensure that attachments on
    merge requests and comments will still be downloadable post-migration.

## Migration Process

1. **Perform a backup of your source GitLab EE instance**

    Follow
    [these instructions](http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/raketasks/backup_restore.html)
    to perform a backup on the GitLab EE instance from which you are migrating.

    After the backup process is complete, it will report the name of the backup
    file created:

    `...
     done
     Dumping uploads ...
     done
     Dumping builds ...
     done
     Creating backup archive: 1446498774_gitlab_backup.tar ... done
     Uploading backup archive to remote storage  ... skipped
     ...
    `

    It is important to note the name of the backup file in the above output, as
    well as the timestamp (numeric) portion of the file. In the above case, the
    file is called `1446498774_gitlab_backup.tar` and the timestamp portion
    of the file is `1446498774`.

    Backup files are created under the `/var/opt/gitlab/backups/` directory.

1. **Copy the backup archive to the destination GitSwarm EE instance**

    The backup process above will result in the creation of a .tar file, which
    contains a backup of your workflow (users, projects, merge requests) as well
    as the corresponding Git repositories. You will need to copy the file
    created above to the GitSwarm EE instance you are restoring to, and place
    the file under `/var/opt/gitswarm/backups/`.

    The backup file will be owned by the `git` user, so you will either need to
    perform the copy as `git`, or change the file permissions so the file can be
    read. For example, with the file above:

    `chmod a+r /var/opt/gitlab/backups/1446498774_gitlab_backup.tar`

1. **Restore the backup archive against the destination GitSwarm EE instance**

    Before performing the restore, please review the
    [following note](#additional-help), since a workaround regarding attachments
    may apply to your migration.

    Follow [these instructions](/help/raketasks/backup_restore.md#omnibus-installations)
    for restoring the backup on your GitSwarm EE instance, ensuring that you use
    the correct `TIMESTAMP` value that you made note of in step 1 of the
    migration process.

    This process will restore the database, upgrade it to the latest GitSwarm EE
    schema, and then restore any backed-up repositories to your GitSwarm EE
    instance. Once the backup process is complete and your GitSwarm EE instance
    has been (re)started, you can then continue with enabling
    [mirroring for your existing projects](/help/workflow/importing/import_from_gitfusion.md),
    to gain the full benefit of using GitSwarm EE.

## Additional Help

1. **Attachments can only be migrated if the hostname of the GitSwarm EE
     instance matches the originating GitLab EE instance.**

    This is a known issue; the workaround is to ensure that the GitSwarm EE
    instance to which you are restoring has the same fully-qualified domain name
    (FQDN) as the GitLab EE instance from which you took the backup. You will
    also need to update the `external_url` entry in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`
    before performing the restore.

1. **After performing the restore, running the recommended check results in the
     following file permissions errors:**
    `
    Repo base access is drwxrws---? ... no
      Try fixing it:
      sudo chmod -R ug+rwX,o-rwx /var/opt/gitswarm/git-data/repositories
      sudo chmod -R ug-s /var/opt/gitswarm/git-data/repositories
      find /var/opt/gitswarm/git-data/repositories -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod g+s
      For more information see:
      doc/install/installation.md in section "GitLab Shell"
      Please fix the error above and rerun the checks.
    hooks directories in repos are links: ...
    `
    `
    Tmp directory writable? ... yes
    Uploads directory setup correctly? ... no
      Try fixing it:
      sudo chmod 0750 /var/opt/gitswarm/gitlab-rails/uploads
      For more information see:
      doc/install/installation.md in section "GitLab"
      Please fix the error above and rerun the checks.
    Init script exists? ... skipped (omnibus-gitlab has no init script)
    Init script up-to-date? ... skipped (omnibus-gitlab has no init script)
    projects have namespace: ...
    `
    These problems can be corrected by running the following commands:
    `
    sudo chmod -R ug+rwX,o-rwx /var/opt/gitswarm/git-data/repositories
    sudo chmod -R ug-s /var/opt/gitswarm/git-data/repositories
    find /var/opt/gitswarm/git-data/repositories -type d -print0 | sudo xargs -0 chmod g+s
    sudo chmod 0750 /var/opt/gitswarm/gitlab-rails/uploads
    `

1.  **When performing a restore, the following database error may be seen:**

    `
    psql:/var/opt/gitlab/backups/db/database.sql:22: ERROR:  must be owner of extension plpgsql
    psql:/var/opt/gitlab/backups/db/database.sql:2931: WARNING:  no privileges could be revoked for "public" (two occurences)
    psql:/var/opt/gitlab/backups/db/database.sql:2933: WARNING:  no privileges were granted for "public" (two occurences)
