# GitLab Pages

> **Note:** The GitLab Pages feature is currently not enabled, and GitSwarm
> EE 2016.1 does not present any of this feature's documentation.
>
> GitLab Pages was introduced in GitLab 8.4 (upon which GitSwarm EE 2016.1
> is based), and was notably improved in GitLab 8.5. The GitSwarm EE team
> is working hard to maintain feature parity, and we should be able to
> fully include/support GitLab Pages in a future release (hopefully, within
> 2016.2).
