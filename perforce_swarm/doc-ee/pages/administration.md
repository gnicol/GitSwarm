# GitLab Pages Administration

> **Note:** This feature was first introduced in $GitSwarm$ 2016.1. Custom
> CNAMEs with TLS support were introduced in $GitSwarm$ 2016.2.

---

This document describes how to set up the _latest_ GitLab Pages feature.
Make sure to read the [changelog](#changelog) if you are upgrading to a new
$GitSwarm$ version as it may include new features and changes needed to be
made in your configuration.

If you are looking for ways to upload your static content in GitLab Pages, you
probably want to read the [user documentation](README.md).

## The GitLab Pages daemon

Starting from $GitSwarm$ 2016.2, GitLab Pages make use of the [GitLab Pages
daemon], a simple HTTP server written in Go that can listen on an external
IP address and provide support for custom domains and custom certificates.
The GitLab Pages Daemon supports dynamic certificates through SNI and
exposes pages using HTTP2 by default.

Here is a brief list with what it is supported when using the pages daemon:

- Multiple domains per-project
- One TLS certificate per-domain
  - Validation of certificate
  - Validation of certificate chain
  - Validation of private key against certificate

You are encouraged to read its [README][pages-readme] to fully understand
how it works.

[gitlab pages daemon]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages
[pages-readme]: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/blob/master/README.md

### The GitLab Pages daemon and the case of custom domains

In the case of custom domains, the Pages daemon needs to listen on ports
`80` and/or `443`. For that reason, there is some flexibility in the way
which you can set it up, so you basically have three choices:

1. Run the pages daemon in the same server as $GitSwarm$, listening on a
   secondary IP.
1. Run the pages daemon in a separate server. In that case, the [Pages
   path](#change-storage-path) must also be present in the server that the
   pages daemon is installed, so you will have to share it via network.
1. Run the pages daemon in the same server as $GitSwarm$, listening on the
   same IP but on different ports. In that case, you will have to proxy the
   traffic with a loadbalancer. If you choose that route note that you
   should use TCP load balancing for HTTPS. If you use TLS-termination
   (HTTPS-load balancing) the pages will not be able to be served with user
   provided certificates. For HTTP it's OK to use HTTP or TCP load
   balancing.

In this document, we will proceed assuming the first option. Let's begin by
installing the pages daemon.

### Install the Pages daemon

**Source installations**

```
cd /home/git
sudo -u git -H git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages.git
cd gitlab-pages
sudo -u git -H git checkout v0.2.1
sudo -u git -H make
```

**Package installations**

The `gitlab-pages` daemon is included in the $GitSwarm$ package.


## Configuration

There are multiple ways to set up GitLab Pages according to what URL scheme
you are willing to support.

### Configuration prerequisites

This section includes all possible scenarios to choose from.

For any scenario, you need:

1. To use the [GitLab Pages daemon](#the-gitlab-pages-daemon)
1. A separate domain
1. A separate Nginx configuration file which needs to be explicitly added
   in the server under which $GitSwarm$ runs (package installations do that
   automatically)
1. (Optional) A wildcard certificate for that domain if you decide to serve
   pages under HTTPS
1. (Optional but recommended) [Shared runners](../ci/runners/README.md) so
   that your users don't have to bring their own

### Configuration scenarios

Before proceeding with setting up GitLab Pages, you have to decide which
route you want to take.

The possible scenarios are depicted in the table below.

| URL scheme | Option | Wildcard certificate | Custom domain with HTTP support | Custom domain with HTTPS support | Secondary IP |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `http://page.example.io`  | 1 | no  |  no | no | no |
| `https://page.example.io` | 1 | yes |  no | no | no |
| `http://page.example.io` and `http://page.com`   | 2 | no  |  yes    | no  | yes |
| `https://page.example.io` and `https://page.com` | 2 | yes |  redirects to HTTPS | yes | yes |

As you see from the table above, each URL scheme comes with an option:

1. Pages enabled, daemon is enabled and NGINX will proxy all requests to
   the daemon. Pages daemon doesn't listen to the outside world.
1. Pages enabled, daemon is enabled AND pages has external IP support
   enabled.  In that case, the pages daemon is running, NGINX still proxies
   requests to the daemon but the daemon is also able to receive requests
   from the outside world. Custom domains and TLS are supported.

### DNS configuration

GitLab Pages expect to run on their own virtual host. In your DNS
server/provider you need to add a [wildcard DNS A
record][wiki-wildcard-dns] pointing to the host that $GitSwarm$ runs. For
example, an entry would look like this:

```
*.example.io. 1800 IN A 1.2.3.4
```

where `example.io` is the domain under which GitLab Pages will be served
and `1.2.3.4` is the IP address of your $GitSwarm$ instance.

You should not use the $GitSwarm$ domain to serve user pages. For more
information see the [security section](#security).

[wiki-wildcard-dns]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record

## Setting up GitLab Pages

Below are the four scenarios that are described in
[#configuration-scenarios](#configuration-scenarios).

### Custom domains with HTTPS support

**Source installations:**

1.  [Install the pages daemon](#install-the-pages-daemon)
1.  Edit `gitlab.yml` to look like the example below. You need to change
    the `host` to the FQDN under which GitLab Pages will be served. Set
    `external_http` and `external_https` to the secondary IP on which the
    pages daemon will listen for connections:

    ```yaml
    ## GitLab Pages
    pages:
      enabled: true
      # The location where pages are stored (default: shared/pages).
      # path: shared/pages

      host: example.io
      port: 443
      https: true

      external_http: 1.1.1.1:80
      external_https: 1.1.1.1:443
    ```

1.  Edit `/etc/default/gitlab` and set `gitlab_pages_enabled` to `true` in
    order to enable the pages daemon. In `gitlab_pages_options` the
    `-pages-domain`, `-listen-http` and `-listen-https` must match the
    `host`, `external_http` and `external_https` settings that you set
    above respectively.  The `-root-cert` and `-root-key` settings are the
    wildcard TLS certificates of the `example.io` domain:

    ```
    gitlab_pages_enabled=true
    gitlab_pages_options="-pages-domain example.io -pages-root $app_root/shared/pages -listen-proxy 127.0.0.1:8090 -listen-http 1.1.1.1:80 -listen-https 1.1.1.1:443 -root-cert /path/to/example.io.crt -root-key /path/to/example.io.key
    ```

1.  Make sure to [configure NGINX](#nginx-configuration) properly.
1.  [Restart $GitSwarm$][restart]

---

**Package installations:**

1. Edit `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`:

    ```ruby
    pages_external_url "https://example.io"
    nginx['listen_addresses'] = ['1.1.1.1']
    pages_nginx['enable'] = false
    gitlab_pages['cert'] = "/etc/gitswarm/ssl/example.io.crt"
    gitlab_pages['cert_key'] = "/etc/gitswarm/ssl/example.io.key"
    gitlab_pages['external_http'] = '1.1.1.2:80'
    gitlab_pages['external_https'] = '1.1.1.2:443'
    ```

    where `1.1.1.1` is the primary IP address that $GitSwarm$ is listening
    to and `1.1.1.2` the secondary IP where the GitLab Pages daemon listens
    to. Read more at the [NGINX configuration for custom
    domains](#nginx-configuration-for-custom-domains) section.

1. [Reconfigure $GitSwarm$][reconfigure]

### Custom domains without HTTPS support

**Source installations:**

1.  [Install the pages daemon](#install-the-pages-daemon)
1.  Edit `gitlab.yml` to look like the example below. You need to change
    the `host` to the FQDN under which GitLab Pages will be served. Set
    `external_http` to the secondary IP on which the pages daemon will
    listen for connections:

    ```yaml
    pages:
      enabled: true
      # The location where pages are stored (default: shared/pages).
      # path: shared/pages

      host: example.io
      port: 80
      https: false

      external_http: 1.1.1.1:80
    ```

1.  Edit `/etc/default/gitlab` and set `gitlab_pages_enabled` to `true` in
    order to enable the pages daemon. In `gitlab_pages_options` the
    `-pages-domain` and `-listen-http` must match the `host` and
    `external_http` settings that you set above respectively:

    ```
    gitlab_pages_enabled=true
    gitlab_pages_options="-pages-domain example.io -pages-root $app_root/shared/pages -listen-proxy 127.0.0.1:8090 -listen-http 1.1.1.1:80"
    ```

1.  Make sure to [configure NGINX](#nginx-configuration) properly.
1.  [Restart $GitSwarm$][restart]

---

**Package installations:**

1. Edit `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`:

    ```ruby
    pages_external_url "https://example.io"
    nginx['listen_addresses'] = ['1.1.1.1']
    pages_nginx['enable'] = false
    gitlab_pages['external_http'] = '1.1.1.2:80'
    ```

    where `1.1.1.1` is the primary IP address that $GitSwarm$ is listening
    to and `1.1.1.2` the secondary IP where the GitLab Pages daemon listens
    to  Read more at the [NGINX configuration for custom
    domains](#nginx-configuration-for-custom-domains) section.

1. [Reconfigure $GitSwarm$][reconfigure]

### Wildcard HTTP domain without custom domains

**Source installations:**

1.  [Install the pages daemon](#install-the-pages-daemon)
1.  Go to the GitLab installation directory:

     ```bash
     cd /home/git/gitlab
     ```

1.  Edit `gitlab.yml` and under the `pages` setting, set `enabled` to
    `true` and the `host` to the FQDN under which GitLab Pages will be
    served:

    ```yaml
    ## GitLab Pages
    pages:
      enabled: true
      # The location where pages are stored (default: shared/pages).
      # path: shared/pages

      host: example.io
      port: 80
      https: false
    ```

1.  Make sure to [configure NGINX](#nginx-configuration) properly.
1.  [Restart $GitSwarm$][restart]

---

**Package installations:**

1. Set the external URL for GitLab Pages in `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`:

    ```ruby
    pages_external_url 'http://example.io'
    ```

1. [Reconfigure $GitSwarm$][reconfigure]

### Wildcard HTTPS domain without custom domains

**Source installations:**

1. [Install the pages daemon](#install-the-pages-daemon)
1. In `gitlab.yml`, set the port to `443` and https to `true`:

     ```bash
     ## GitLab Pages
     pages:
       enabled: true
       # The location where pages are stored (default: shared/pages).
       # path: shared/pages

       host: example.io
       port: 443
       https: true
     ```

1. Make sure to [configure NGINX](#nginx-configuration) properly.

---

**Package installations:**

1. Place the certificate and key inside `/etc/gitswarm/ssl`
1. In `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb` specify the following configuration:

    ```ruby
    pages_external_url 'https://example.io'

    pages_nginx['redirect_http_to_https'] = true
    pages_nginx['ssl_certificate'] = "/etc/gitswarm/ssl/pages-nginx.crt"
    pages_nginx['ssl_certificate_key'] = "/etc/gitswarm/ssl/pages-nginx.key"
    ```

    where `pages-nginx.crt` and `pages-nginx.key` are the SSL cert and key,
    respectively.

1. [Reconfigure $GitSwarm$][reconfigure]

## NGINX configuration

Depending on your setup, you will need to make some changes to NGINX.
Specifically you must change the domain name and the IP address where NGINX
listens to. Read the following sections for more details.

### NGINX configuration files

Copy the `gitlab-pages-ssl` Nginx configuration file:

```bash
sudo cp lib/support/nginx/gitlab-pages-ssl /etc/nginx/sites-available/gitlab-pages-ssl.conf
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-{available,enabled}/gitlab-pages-ssl.conf
```

Replace `gitlab-pages-ssl` with `gitlab-pages` if you are not using SSL.

### NGINX configuration for custom domains

> **Note:** If you are not using custom domains ignore this section.

[In the case of custom domains](#the-gitlab-pages-daemon-and-the-case-of-custom-domains),
if you have the secondary IP address configured on the same server as
$GitSwarm$, you need to change **all** NGINX configs to listen on the first
IP address.

**Source installations:**

1. Edit all $GitSwarm$ related configs in `/etc/nginx/site-available/` and
   replace `0.0.0.0` with `1.1.1.1`, where `1.1.1.1` the primary IP where
   $GitSwarm$ listens to.
1. Restart NGINX

**Package installations:**

1. Edit `/etc/gitswarm/giswarm.rb`:

    ```
    nginx['listen_addresses'] = ['1.1.1.1']
    ```

1. [Reconfigure$ GitSwarm$][reconfigure]

### NGINX caveats

Be extra careful when setting up the domain name in the NGINX config. You
must not remove the backslashes.

If your GitLab Pages domain is `example.io`, replace:

```bash
server_name ~^.*\.YOUR_GITLAB_PAGES\.DOMAIN$;
```

with:

```
server_name ~^.*\.example\.io$;
```

If you are using a subdomain, make sure to escape all dots (`.`) except
from the first one with a backslash (\). For example `pages.example.io`
would be:

```
server_name ~^.*\.pages\.example\.io$;
```

## Set maximum pages size

The maximum size of the unpacked archive per project can be configured in
the Admin area under the Application settings in the **Maximum size of
pages (MB)**. The default is 100MB.

## Change storage path

**Source installations:**

1.  Pages are stored by default in `/home/git/gitlab/shared/pages`. If you
    wish to store them in another location you must set it up in
    `gitlab.yml` under the `pages` section:

    ```yaml
    pages:
      enabled: true
      # The location where pages are stored (default: shared/pages).
      path: /mnt/storage/pages
    ```

1. [Restart $GitSwarm$][restart]

**Package installations:**

1.  Pages are stored by default in
    `/var/opt/gitswarm/gitlab-rails/shared/pages`. If you wish to store
    them in another location you must set it up in
    `/etc/gitswarm/gitswarm.rb`:

     ```ruby
     gitlab_rails['pages_path'] = "/mnt/storage/pages"
     ```

1. [Reconfigure $GitSwarm$][reconfigure]

## Backup

Pages are part of the [regular backup][backup] so there is nothing to
configure.

## Security

You should strongly consider running GitLab Pages under a different hostname
than $GitSwarm$ to prevent XSS attacks.
