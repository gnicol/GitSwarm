# Enforce Two-factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor Authentication (2FA) provides an additional level of security to
your users' GitSwarm EE account. Once enabled, in addition to supplying
their username and password to login, they'll be prompted for a code
generated by an application on their phone.

You can read more about it here: [Two-factor Authentication
(2FA)](../profile/two_factor_authentication.md)

## Enabling 2FA

Users on GitSwarm EE, can enable it without any admin's intervention. If
you want to enforce everyone to setup 2FA, you can choose from two
different ways:

 1. Enforce on next login
 2. Suggest on next login, but allow a grace period before enforcing.

In the Admin area under **Settings** (`/admin/application_settings`), look
for the "Sign-in Restrictions" area, where you can configure both.

If you want 2FA enforcement to take effect on next login, change the grace
period to `0`.

## Disabling 2FA for everyone

There may be some special situations where you want to disable 2FA for
everyone even when forced 2FA is disabled. There is a rake task for that:

```bash
sudo gitswarm-rake gitlab:two_factor:disable_for_all_users
```

**IMPORTANT: this is a permanent and irreversible action. Users will have
to reactivate 2FA from scratch if they want to use it again.**
