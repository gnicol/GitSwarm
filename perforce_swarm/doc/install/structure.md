# GitSwarm directory structure

This is the directory structure you will end up with following the
[installation instructions](README.md).

- `/opt/gitswarm` holds application code for GitSwarm and its dependencies.
- `/var/opt/gitswarm` holds application data and configuration files that
  gitswarm-ctl reconfigure writes to.
- `/etc/gitswarm` holds configuration files for GitSwarm. These are the only
  files that you should ever have to edit manually.
- `/var/log/gitswarm` contains all log data generated by components of
  GitSwarm.

Within `/var/opt/gitswarm`, the following directories exist:

* `.ssh` - contains OpenSSH settings. Specifically the `authorized_keys`
  file managed by gitlab-shell.
* `gitlab-satellites` - checked out repositories for merge requests and
  file editing from web UI. This can be treated as a temporary files
  directory.
* `gitlab-shell` - Core add-on component of GitSwarm. Maintains SSH cloning
  and other functionality.
* `repositories` - bare repositories for all projects organized by
  namespace.  This is where the git repositories which are pushed/pulled
  are maintained for all projects.  **This area is critical data for
  projects. [Keep a backup](../raketasks/backup_restore.md)**

To see a more in-depth overview see the [GitSwarm architecture doc](../development/architecture.md).
