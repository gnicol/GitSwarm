# Project importing from GitHub to GitSwarm

You can import your existing GitHub projects to GitSwarm. But keep in mind
that it is possible only if GitHub support is enabled on your GitSwarm
instance. You can read more about GitHub support
[here](../integration/github.md) To get to the importer page you need to go
to "New project" page.

Click on the "Import project from GitHub" button and you will be redirected
to GitHub for permission to access your projects. After accepting, you'll
be automatically redirected to the importer.

To import a project, you can simple click "Add". The importer will import
your repository and issues. Once the importer is done, a new GitSwarm
project will be created with your imported data.
