  # can be skipped by overriding them with a test in the perforce_swarm engine
  #
  # to override a test you must create a new test inside of the engine
  # that meets all of the following criteria:
  #
  # 1) the new test must be in a file that has the same relative filepath
  # to the perforce_swarm/spec folder as the original test has to the spec folder
  # 2) the new test must have the 'override: true' tag applied to it
  # 3) must exist inside of the same structure of nested describe, context, and it
  # blocks with the exact same descriptions for each block
